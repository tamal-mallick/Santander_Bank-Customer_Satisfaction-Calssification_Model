Kaggle Problem: https://www.kaggle.com/c/santander-customer-satisfaction/overview
Santander Bank wants to identify dissatisfied customers early in their relationship. Doing so Santander may take proactive steps to improve a customer's happiness before it's too late.

In this problem, there are hundreds of anonymized features to predict if a customer is satisfied or dissatisfied with their banking experience. It's a binary class classification problem, which is needed to be solved using machine learning claassification algorithms. There are 370 different features and 76020 datapoints in the dataset.

I solved it with decision tree in python. The the notebook is attached as a seperate file.
